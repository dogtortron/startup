### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Use of correct HTML structure for the game. Four HTML pages. One for login, one for playing, one for scoreboard, and one for the about page.
- **CSS** - Animation of the bird. Game styling that looks good on different screen sizes. 
- **JavaScript** - Login input, sound display, display of other users and scores.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving scores
- **DB** - Store users and scores in database.
- **Authentication** - Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database.
- **WebSocket** - After each user played, their best score is displayed on the scoreboard.

## HTML Deliverable
For this deliverable I added the application structure.
- **HTML pages** - Fours HTML pages, one for login, one for play, one for scoreboard, one for about.
- **Links** - Each page has links to the other pages. The About page has a link to an external source.
- **Text** - The Bird of the Day section in the About page pulls text and sound from a source to display.
- **Images** - An SVG image of a bird in the Login page. (There's a video but it's not in the rubric)
- **Login** - Input box and submit button for login
- **Database** - The Scoreboard page shows data pulled from the database.
- **WebSocket** - The Play page has a live section of who's doing what (scoring, entering, or exiting the game)

## CSS Deliverable
For this deliverable, I made the application look cute.
- **Header, footer, and main content body** - They're there.
- **Navigation elements** - I added brand logo, dropped the underline, changed the font, added dropdown toggle for mobile view.
- **Responsive to window resizing** - My app looks good on all window sizes and devices. Menu turns to a toggle and the video got dropped in mobile view.
- **Application elements** - Colors go well together, whitespace is appropriate. There're video and picture. Flex ratio is good.
- **Application text content** - Consistent fonts. 
- **Application images** - I added image to the play page, and a logo for the brand.
