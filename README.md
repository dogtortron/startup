### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Use of correct HTML structure for the game. Four HTML pages. One for login, one for playing, one for scoreboard, and one for the about page.
- **CSS** - Animation of the bird. Game styling that looks good on different screen sizes. 
- **JavaScript** - Login input, sound display, display of other users and scores.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving scores
- **DB** - Store users and scores in database.
- **Authentication** - Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database.
- **WebSocket** - After each user played, their best score is displayed on the scoreboard.

## HTML Deliverable
For this deliverable I added the application structure.
- **HTML pages** - Fours HTML pages, one for login, one for play, one for scoreboard, one for about.
- **Links** - Each page has links to the other pages. The About page has a link to an external source.
- **Text** - The About page has a description of how the game was inspired.
- **Images** - An SVG image of a bird in the Login page.
- **Videos** - A Youtube video in the About page.
- **Login** - Input box and submit button for login
