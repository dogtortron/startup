### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to use keyboard/touch screen to interact and play sounds
- Display of user playing in real time
- Ability to rank users according to their scores
- Display of a scoreboard


### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Use of correct HTML structure for the game. Four HTML pages. One for login, one for playing, one for scoreboard, and one for the about page.
- **CSS** - Animation of the bird. Game styling that looks good on different screen sizes. 
- **JavaScript** - Login input, sound display, display of other users and scores.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving scores
- **DB** - Store users and scores in database.
- **Authentication** - Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database.
- **WebSocket** - After each user played, their best score is displayed on the scoreboard.

## HTML Deliverable
For this deliverable I added the application structure.
- **HTML pages** - Fours HTML pages, one for login, one for play, one for scoreboard, one for about.
- **Links** - Each page has links to the other pages. The About page has a link to an external source.
- **Text** - The Bird of the Day section in the About page pulls text and sound from a source to display.
- **Images** - An SVG image of a bird in the Login page. (There's a video but it's not in the rubric)
- **Login** - Input box and submit button for login
- **Database** - The Scoreboard page shows data pulled from the database.
- **WebSocket** - The Play page has a live section of who's doing what (scoring, entering, or exiting the game)

## CSS Deliverable
For this deliverable, I made the application look cute.
- **Header, footer, and main content body** - They're there.
- **Navigation elements** - I added brand logo, dropped the underline, changed the font, added dropdown toggle for mobile view.
- **Responsive to window resizing** - My app looks good on all window sizes and devices. Menu turns to a toggle and the video got dropped in mobile view.
- **Application elements** - Colors go well together, whitespace is appropriate. There're video and picture. Flex ratio is good.
- **Application text content** - Consistent fonts. 
- **Application images** - I added image to the play page, and a logo for the brand.

## JavaScript Deliverable
For this deliverable I made my application functional for users to play game
- **Login** - When you enter your name and press login, it takes you to the playing page.
- **Database** - Displays the users and their scores. Currently this is stored and retrieved from local storage, but it will be replaced with the database data later.
- **WebSocket** - I used the setInterval function to periodically add a new user. This will be replaced with WebSocket messages later.
- **Application logic** - Fully functional game. For now it's like Simon in terms of sequencing the button order, but in Simon the user can actually cheat if they really wanted to, but not here haha. A few functions are added to make the message from the game to the user more informative. I didn't have enough time to make it "more musical", meaning a note to be held longer and users are tested by the ability to produce the sequence AND the timing right.

## Service Deliverable
For this deliverable I created an HTTP service to host my frontend and provide backend endpoints.
- **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - done.
- **Static middleware for frontend** - done.
- **Calls to third party endpoints** - done.
- **Backend service endpoints** - Placeholders for login that stores the current user on the server.
- **Frontend calls service endpoints** - Used fetch function.

## DB Deliverable
For this deliverable I stored and retrieved data from MongoDB.
- **MongoDB Atlas database created** - done!
- **Backend endpoints for manipulating application data** - done.
- **Stores data in MongoDB** - done!

## Login Deliverable
For this deliverable I added user registration and authentication.
- **User registration** - Creates a new account in the database.
- **existing user** - Verifies the user's name and password from data stored in the database
- **Use MongoDB to store credentials** - done!
- **Restricts functionality** - You cannot play until you have logged in.
