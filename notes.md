# AWS Account

Before we get started with anything else, you need to create an account with Amazon Web Services (AWS). You want to do this as soon as possible as you will need it for much of the work in this course and it might take some time to authorize your account.

There are lots of other great vendors out there, but AWS is by far the leader in the space and so it is good for you to get experience with them. Follow these instructions on how to an [account with AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/). When you create your account make sure you remember your account ID so that you can use it when you log in to the AWS browser console.

## What is this going to cost you?

There is no cost to create an account with AWS, you only pay for what you use, and in many cases they will give you a significant starting credit, and [some services are free](https://aws.amazon.com/free) for a short period of time or monthly usage. The services we are going to use include the following:

| Service        | Purpose                              | Estimated Cost (subject to change)                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EC2            | Server                               | t3.nano $0.0052 an hour ($3.50/month), t3.micro $0.0104 an hour ($7.00/month), t3.small $0.0208 an hour ($14.00/month) |
| EC2 Elastic IP | Keep your IP address between reboots | First one is free if you keep it associated with a running server. $0.0052 an hour otherwise.                          |
| Route 53       | Domain name                          | $3/year for `click` TLD. More for others                                                                               |
| Route 53       | DNS records                          | $0.50 a month for each root domain                                                                                     |
|                |                                      | Estimated total: `$15` - `$50` for the course. Much cheaper than a textbook.                                           |

There are lots of ways to get free usage of services. For example, as of when this was written, you can get a 750 hours a month, for the first 12 months, of a Linux t2.micro server instance.

# The Console

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Command line crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line)

Before the creation of graphical user interfaces, all computing systems were simple console environments consisting as of a prompt for inputting a command and the display of the command output. All of the original programming tools ran as console application. The console tradition is still actively used by professional developers and most programming tools execute within a console window.

Also known as the command line, shell, or terminal, the console window is an essential web development tool. The console provides access to the file system and allows for the execution of command line applications.

There are many console applications that you can chose from. All operating systems come with a default console, but you will probably want to install one in order to get the best experience. Here is an example of [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) running on a Mac.

## Make sure you have a console application

In order for you to successfully use the console for web programming it must be [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant. POSIX compliance means that it supports a standard set of console commands. Both Mac and Linix support POSIX. That means any necessary console commands will work on those operating systems.

## Getting a console application for Windows

If you are using Microsoft Windows you can get a reasonable approximation of a POSIX compliant console by installing [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win). When installing use all the default settings.

Once it is installed, hit the Windows button on your keyboard, and type `Git Bash`. This should open a console window that looks something like the following. Make sure you look for the `Git Bash` icon so that you don't accidentally use an non-POSIX compatible console application.

![Git Bash](gitBash.jpg)

⚠ Do not use `Git Command`, `cmd`, or `Powershell`. That will not work for the commands and scripts we run in this class.

You can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) (e.g Ubuntu on Windows) for your work in this class, but you must be very careful to do all of your work actually within WSL. Don't download files to your Windows partition and then access them from WSL. It is suggested that you use `Git Bash` instead of WSL, unless you are really familiar with WSL.

### Testing your console application

Once you have a acceptable console application on your development computer, open it up and make sure you can run a simple POSIX compliant command such as `printf 'hello\n'`.

![Console printf](consolePrintf.jpg)

If this displays `hello` then you are on the right track. If that doesn't work then you are using a console application that is not POSIX compliant. For example, Windows Powershell will not work.

## Viewing the file system

One of the primary purposes of a console application is to view the files on the computer. The files on a computer are organized into a tree structure of nodes called directories. At any given point in time your console is located at one of the directories in the file system. You can see which directory you are in with the `pwd` (present working directory) command.

```sh
➜  pwd

/Users/student/byu//webprogramming260
```

You can list all of the files in the directory with `ls` (list files). Most command line applications take parameters that are specified after you type the application name. For example, `ls` can list all files (even hidden ones) in a long format if you provide the parameter `-la`.

```sh
➜ ls -la

total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 lee  staff   1.0K Nov 19 08:47 LICENSE
-rw-r--r--  1 lee  staff    82B Nov 19 08:47 README.md
drwxr-xr-x  4 lee  staff   128B Nov 19 08:48 profile
drwxr-xr-x  4 lee  staff   128B Nov 19 08:47 react
```

## Executing commands

The other primary purpose of the console is to execute commands. You already did this in the previous section when you executed commands for working with the file system. However, console commands can perform many different operations. Here are some basic commands that you show experiment with.

- **echo** - Output the parameters of the command
- **cd** - Change directory
- **mkdir** - Make directory
- **rmdir** - Remove directory
- **rm** - Remove file(s)
- **mv** - Move file(s)
- **cp** - Copy files
- **ls** - List files
- **curl** - Command line client URL browser
- **grep** - Regular expression search
- **find** - Find files
- **top** - View running processes with CPU and memory usage
- **df** - View disk statistics
- **cat** - Output the contents of a file
- **less** - Interactively output the contents of a file
- **wc** - Count the words in a file
- **ps** - View the currently running processes
- **kill** - Kill a currently running process
- **sudo** - Execute a command as a super user (admin)
- **ssh** - Create a secure shell on a remote computer
- **scp** - Securely copy files to a remote computer
- **history** - Show the history of commands
- **ping** - Check if a website is up
- **tracert** - Trace the connections to a website
- **dig** - Show the DNS information for a domain
- **man** - Look up a command in the manual

You can also chain the input and output of commands using special characters

- `|` - Take the output from the command on the left and _pipe_, or pass, it to the command on the right
- `>` - Redirect output to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists
- `>>` - Redirect output to a file. Appends if the file exists

For example, you can list the files in a directory, pipe it into `grep` to search for files created in Nov, and then pipe that into `wc` to count the number of files found with a date of Nov.

```
ls -l | grep ' Nov ' | wc -l
```

There are also keystrokes that have special meaning in the console.

- `CTRL-R` - Use type ahead to find previous commands
- `CTRL-C` - Kill the currently running command
